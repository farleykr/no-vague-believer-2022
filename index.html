            <p>If you find yourself bewildered by this grueling life, standing empty handed like Esau, asking the Father,
                “Haven’t you saved any blessing for me?” you are still basking in God’s providence. If you find yourself
                going to see your Uncle Ishmael because you remember the story about how he was left to die under a bush to
                make room for your dad and you think he might understand your heartache, you are still a part of God’s plan.
                If you find yourself feeling like collateral damage in the culling of God’s chosen ones, you are still loved
                by Him. Those who are left under bushes to die and those who are stolen from and those who are furious that
                God does not have to answer to us are still hurtling through outer space on this God-cherished ball of mud
                under the scorching gaze of His loving eyes.</p>
            <p>To follow Christ is to visit your uncle, sit in a rusty lawn chair, look out over a yard infested with weeds
                and sun bleached Fisher-Price toys, drink gas station beer, bitch about your entitled brother, and sink into
                obscurity like the setting sun while Jesus—the only brother who won’t steal from you—sits in heaven making
                deals with God.</p>
